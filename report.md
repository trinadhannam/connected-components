# **Comprehensive Report: Connected Components Computation using PySpark**

---

## **Introduction**

Graph analysis is a cornerstone of many domains, such as web analytics, social networks, and computational biology. Identifying **connected components** is a fundamental task, where the goal is to partition the graph into subsets of nodes that are interconnected. This report outlines the implementation of connected components detection using **PySpark**, a distributed framework for big data processing. The performance and scalability of the approach are evaluated on a range of datasets, including real-world and synthetic graphs.

## **Implementation Details**

### **1. Algorithm Overview**

The implementation iteratively identifies connected components in an undirected graph using Spark's distributed RDDs. Key steps in the algorithm include:

- **Initialization:** Start with an edge list representation of the graph.
- **Union Operation:** Add reversed edges to ensure bidirectionality.
- **Reduce Operation:** Group edges by nodes and propagate minimum node labels, enabling component identification.
- **Termination:** Stop when no new connections are added, signifying convergence.

### **2. Key Components**

#### **Spark Session and Context Initialization**
```python
spark_session = SparkSession.builder.appName("PySpark Connected Components").getOrCreate()
spark_context = spark_session.sparkContext
```
A Spark session is initialized, and the level of parallelism is controlled through the number of mappers and reducers.

#### **Data Loading**
```python
def load_dataset(path):
    return spark_context.textFile(path, minPartitions=NUM_MAPPERS)
```
The graph data is loaded from a file, and the number of mappers is explicitly set for controlled parallelism.

#### **Preprocessing**
```python
def preprocess_rdd(rdd):
    return rdd.filter(lambda x: '#' not in x).map(lambda x: x.strip().split()).map(lambda x: (int(x[0]), int(x[1])))
```
The raw data is cleaned and converted into tuples representing graph edges `(node1, node2)`.

#### **Iterative Mapping and Reducing**
- **Mapping:** Adds reversed edges and repartitions for balanced workload.
- **Reducing:** Groups by keys, computes the minimum label, and updates connections.

```python
def iterate_map_rdd(rdd):
    return rdd.union(rdd.map(lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))).repartition(NUM_MAPPERS)

def count_nb_new_pair(x):
    k, values = x
    min_value = min(k, *values)
    if min_value < k:
        yield (k, min_value)
        for v in values:
            if min_value != v:
                nb_new_pair += 1
                yield (v, min_value)
```

#### **Termination**
```python
while True:
    start_pair_count = nb_new_pair.value
    # Apply map, reduce, and deduplication steps
    if start_pair_count == nb_new_pair.value:
        break
```
The algorithm stops iterating when no new connections are found.

### **Observations**
1. **Graph Density Impacts Connected Components:**
   - Sparse graphs like `web-Google` have many small connected components.
   - Dense graphs like `web-NotreDame` form a single connected component.

2. **Execution Time Trends:**
   - Time increases with graph size (nodes and edges), but the algorithm scales efficiently due to distributed processing.

3. **Component Count Verification:**
   - Synthetic datasets showcase higher connected component counts, likely due to sparsity and random graph generation.

## **Performance Analysis**

### **1. Scalability**
The implementation demonstrates strong scalability with increasing graph size, leveraging Spark's ability to distribute workloads across mappers and reducers.

### **2. Parallelism**
By explicitly setting mappers and reducers:
- **Mappers** control the number of partitions during the map phase.
- **Reducers** determine the level of parallelism during the grouping and reducing phase.

### **3. Memory Optimization**
- Garbage collection (`gc.collect()`) is invoked during each iteration to prevent memory bloat.
- Using Spark's `repartition` ensures even distribution of data for subsequent transformations.

## **Challenges and Solutions**

1. **High Iteration Count for Large Graphs:**
   - Challenge: Larger graphs require more iterations to converge.
   - Solution: Improved heuristics, such as early stopping or optimized data structures, could reduce iterations.

2. **Load Balancing:**
   - Challenge: Uneven partition sizes can cause stragglers.
   - Solution: Explicit repartitioning addresses this issue.

3. **Accumulator Limitations:**
   - Challenge: Accumulators are write-only and may limit debugging.
   - Solution: Logging and tracking additional metrics for deeper insights.
